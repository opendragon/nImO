\primaryStart[ClassesAndTheirInterfaces]{Classes and Their Interfaces}
The \mplusm{} classes are organized into seven namespaces:
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{\mplusm{}::Common} classes that support all the \mplusm{} activities
\item\exSp\textbf{\mplusm{}::Example} classes that demonstrate features of \mplusm{}
\item\exSp\textbf{\mplusm{}::Parser} classes that are used by the
\requestsNameR{Registry~Service}{RegistryService}{match} request of the
\serviceNameR[\RS]{RegistryService}
\item\exSp\textbf{\mplusm{}::Registry} classes that work with the internal database to
manage the \mplusm{} services
\item\exSp\textbf{\mplusm{}::RequestCounter} classes that support measuring the
performance of an \mplusm{} installation
\item\exSp\textbf{\mplusm{}::Test} classes that are used during unit\longDash{}testing of
the \mplusm{} source code
\item\exSp\textbf{\mplusm{}::Utilities} classes that are used only with the \mplusm{}
utility programs
\end{itemize}
There are 48 classes or structures in the \textbf{\mplusm{}::Common} namespace, 39 in
\textbf{\mplusm{}::Example}, 8 in \textbf{\mplusm{}::Parser}, 11 in
\textbf{\mplusm{}::Registry}, 6 in \textbf{\mplusm{}::RequestCounter}, 20 in
\textbf{\mplusm{}::Test} and 12 in \textbf{\mplusm{}::Utilities}.
The following sections describe the most critical of the classes in the
\textbf{\mplusm{}::Common} namespace \longDash{} many of the other classes, in all the
namespaces, derive from these classes. 
\secondaryStart{BaseAdapterData}\classNameM{Common}{BaseAdapterData}
The class \classNameX{Common}{BaseAdapterData} is used to provide common methods and
variables for data that is shared between instances of derived classes of
\classNameR{Common}{BaseAdapterService} and instances of derived classes of
\classNameR{Common}{BaseInputHandler}.
In particular, the shared data includes a reference to the \classNameR{Common}{BaseClient}
that is being communicated with by the adapter and the primary output stream to use when
responding to input data.
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseAdapterData}}
\secondaryStart{BaseAdapterService}\classNameM{Common}{BaseAdapterService}
Instances of derived classes of \classNameX{Common}{BaseAdapterService} are responsible
for managing \mplusm{} communication between one or more standard \yarp{} ports and an
instance of a derived class of \classNameR{Common}{BaseClient}; for example, an instance
of the class \asCode{M+M::Example::RandomNumberAdapter} uses an instance of the class
\asCode{M+M::Example::RandomNumberClient} to make requests to an instance of the class
\asCode{M+M::Example::RandomNumberService}.\\

The bulk of the mechanisms needed to perform this are provided by the
\classNameX{Common}{BaseAdapterService} class itself, and the derived classes need only
provide service\longDash{}specific routines to handle their inputs.
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseAdapterService}}
\secondaryStart{BaseArgumentDescriptor}\classNameM{Utilities}{BaseArgumentDescriptor}
Instances of derived classes of \classNameX{Utilities}{BaseArgumentDescriptor} are
responsible for serializing argument descriptions, providing argument prompts and
validating user input.

service\longDash{}specific routines, such as \asCode{getOneRandomNumber()}, which is a
