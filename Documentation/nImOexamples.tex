\appendixStart{\textitcorr{Examples}}
The examples that are part of the \mplusm{} set of source files are provided to support
the development of custom applications.
There are example clients, services, adapters as well as examples of the more specialized
Input, Output and Filter services.\\

All the example applications respond to a `HUP' signal and will exit gracefully when one
is sent to them.
\secondaryStart{Example~Services}
The set of example services include a pair of simple services
[\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mEchoService} and
\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mRandomNumberService}], a service with client context
[\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mRunningSumService}] as well as two input services
[\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mPlaybackFromJSONInputService} and
\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mRandomBurstInputService}], two output services
[\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mRecordAsJSONOutputService} and\\
\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mRecordIntegersOutputService}] and two filter services
[\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mAbsorberFilterService} and\\
\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mTruncateFloatFilterService}].\\

Note that services normally have no direct interface.
That is, they are `faceless' applications and perform their operations without user
interaction.
\tertiaryStart{\examplesNameP{Services}{m+mAbsorberFilterService}}
The \examplesNameX{Services}{m+mAbsorberFilterService} application is a Filter
service, accepting (and ignoring) any input data, while counting the number of messages
and bytes received, which are (optionally) sent out the `stats' outlet.
The application responds to the standard Filter service requests and can be used as a
standalone data transformer, without the need for a client connection.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{configuration} request has no arguments and
returns the integer value for the `sample interval'.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{configure} request has one argument
\longDash{} an integer value for the `sample interval'.
This value will be applied when the service is started or restarted.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{restartStreams} request stops and then
starts the input stream.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{startStreams} request initiates listening
on the input stream.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{stopStreams} request terminates listening
on the input stream.\\

Note that the application will exit if the \serviceNameR[\RS]{RegistryService} is not
running.
\condPage{}
The application has one optional argument \longDash{} the sample interval in seconds.
If the sample interval is greater than zero, this specifies how often the messages per
second (and bytes per second) are reported.
The statistics are output to the console from which the application was run as well as to
the `stats' outlet.
If the sample interval is not greater than zero, each incoming message is reported as it
is received, along with the total number of bytes received since the service was started
or restarted.
The reporting is only done to the console from which the application was run.

Note that the sample interval can also be set via commands, if the application is
running from a terminal.\\

\tertiaryStart{\examplesNameP{Services}{m+mPlaybackFromJSONInputService}}
The \examplesNameX{Services}{m+mPlaybackFromJSONInputService} application is an Input
service, generating a stream of \yarp{} messages that have been recorded by the
\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mRecordAsJSONOutputService} application in a file.
The application responds to the standard Input service requests and can be used as a
standalone data generator, without the need for a client connection.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{configuration} request has no arguments and
returns the floating\longDash{}point value for the `playback ratio', the
floating\longDash{}point value for the initial delay and an integer value for the
`loop flag'.
The `playback ratio' is a scaling factor for the interval between the sending of each
message from the file; a value of \asBoldCode{1} indicates no scaling while, for example,
a value of \asBoldCode{2} indicates that the messages will be sent half as often as they
were recorded.
A value of \asBoldCode{0} for the `loop flag' indicates no looping \longDash{} the data
contained in the file will be sent once, after the initial delay \longDash{} and a value
of \asBoldCode{1} indicates that the data contained in the file will be sent
continuously.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{configure} request has three arguments
\longDash{} a floating\longDash{}point value for the `playback ratio', a
floating\longDash{}point value for the initial delay and an integer value for the
`loop flag'.
These values will be applied when the playback service is started or restarted.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{restartStreams} request stops and then
starts the playback engine, which restarts the output \yarp{} network connection.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{startStreams} request starts a playback
engine for the output stream, using the configured `playback ratio', `initial delay' and
`loop flag'.
Once started, the playback engine will send the data contained in the specified file via
the output \yarp{} network connection.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{stopStreams} request stops the playback
engine, which stops the output \yarp{} network connection.\\ 

Note that the application will exit if the \serviceNameR[\RS]{RegistryService} is not
running.\\

The application has one required argument \longDash{} the path to the \json{} file
containing the messages to be used.
The application has three optional arguments \longDash{} the playback ratio, the initial
delay in seconds and a flag indicating whether the data is to be sent continuously or just
once.
\insertAppParameters

The other parameters provide the playback ratio, initial delay and loop flag; if not
specified, a playback ratio of \asBoldCode{1}, an initial delay of zero seconds and a loop
flag of \asBoldCode{1} \longDash{} indicating continuous sending of the data \longDash{}
will be used.
Note that the playback ratio, initial delay and loop flag can also be set via commands,
if the application is running from a terminal.\\

The input file name forms part of the names of the channels and is added to the title bar
of the service, as though it were a `tag'.\\

If a `tag' value is supplied, it is merged with the input file name, as shown here:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/playbackJSONWithTag}%
{playbackJSONWithTag}{The \emph{\MMMU} entity for the \emph{Playback From JSON Input}

{playbackJSONWithEndpoint}{The \emph{\MMMU} entity for the \emph{Playback From JSON Input}
service with an endpoint}{1.0}
\condPage{}
If both a `tag' value and an `endpoint' value are provided, the `endpoint' value
determines the channel names while the `tag' value is combined with the input file name

The \examplesNameX{Services}{m+mRandomBurstInputService} application is an Input service,
generating a stream of random floating\longDash{}point values, with a given `burst size'
\longDash{} the number of values sent in a group, and a `burst period' \longDash{} the
number of seconds between groups.
The application responds to the standard Input service requests and can be used as a
standalone data generator, without the need for a client connection.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{configuration} request has no arguments and
returns the floating\longDash{}point value for the `burst period' and an integer value for
the `burst size'.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{configure} request has two arguments
\longDash{} a floating\longDash{}point value for the `burst period' and an integer value

\secondaryStart{Example~Adapters}
Adapters are applications that use a client object to connect to an \mplusm{} service,
routing input from one or more input \yarp{} network connection via the client object to
the service and returning results from the client to one or more output \yarp{} network
connections.\\

The example adapters demonstrate using a single input \yarp{} network connection
[\examplesNameR{Adapters}{m+mRandomNumberAdapter} and
\examplesNameR{Adapters}{m+mRunningSumAltAdapter}] or multiple input \yarp{} network
connections [\examplesNameR{Adapters}{m+mRunningSumAdapter}].\\

Adapters have ten optional parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item\optItem{a}{}{args}{display the argument descriptions for the executable and leave
\longDash{} note that this option is primarily for use by the \emph{\MMMU} application}
\item\exSp\optItem{c}{}{channel}{display the endpoint name after applying all other
options and leave}
\item\exSp\optItem{e}{v}{endpoint}{specifies an alternative endpoint name `\textit{v}' to
be used}
\item\exSp\optItem{g}{}{go}{indicates that the adapter is to be started immediately}
\item\exSp\optItem{h}{}{help}{display the list of optional parameters and arguments and
leave}
\item\exSp\optItem{i}{}{info}{display the type of the executable, the valid options, the
matching criteria used to locate the service to which the adapter will attach and a
description of the executable and leave \longDash{} note that this option is primarily
for use by the \emph{\MMMU} application}
\item\exSp\optItem{p}{v}{port}{specifies the port number `\textit{v}' to be used, if a
non\longDash{}default port is desired}
\item\exSp\optItem{r}{}{report}{report the adapter metrics when the application exits}
\item\exSp\optItem{t}{v}{tag}{specifies the tag `\textit{v}' to be used as part of the
adapter name}
\item\exSp\optItem{v}{}{vers}{display the version and copyright information and leave}
\end{itemize}

Note that adapters normally have no direct interface.
That is, they are `faceless' applications and perform their operations without user
interaction.
\condPage
\tertiaryStart{\examplesNameP{Adapters}{m+mRandomNumberAdapter}}
The \examplesNameX{Adapters}{m+mRandomNumberAdapter} application reads the count of
random numbers desired from an input \yarp{} network connection and sends a
\requestsNameR{Examples}{Examples}{random} request to the
\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mRandomNumberService} application.
The random numbers returned from the service are sent out an output \yarp{} network
connection.
Note that the application will also exit if the \serviceNameR[\RS]{RegistryService} or the
\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mRandomNumberService} application are not running.\\

The \examplesNameX{Adapters}{m+mRunningSumAdapter} application reads  values from an input
`data' \yarp{} network connection and commands from an input `control' \yarp{} network
connection and sends corresponding requests to the
\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mRunningSumService} application.\\

If a numeric value is read from the `data' input \yarp{} network connection, it is sent to
the service via an \requestsNameR{Examples}{Examples}{addtosum} request, to update the
running sum for this adapter.
If a string is read from the `control' input \yarp{} network connection, it is considered
to be one of the following commands:
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{q:} exit the application.
\item\exSp\textbf{r:} send a \requestsNameR{Examples}{Examples}{resetsum} request to the
service so that it will reset the running sum for this adapter.
\item\exSp\textbf{s:} send a \requestsNameR{Examples}{Examples}{startsum} request to the

\item\exSp\textbf{x:} send a \requestsNameR{Examples}{Examples}{stopsum} request to the
service so that it will stop calculating the running sum for this adapter.
\end{itemize}
The running sums returned from the service are sent out an output \yarp{} network
connection.\\
