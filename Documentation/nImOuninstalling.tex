The files for an \mplusm{} installation are all contained within the
\asCode{/opt/m+m} directory; note that Administrator privileges are needed to remove the
installation.\\

Included in the set of installed files is a script to perform the removal,

To use it, open the \asCode{Terminal} program and enter the following:
\outputBegin
\begin{verbatim}
uninstallm+m.sh

\outputEnd{}
You will then be presented with an opportunity to cancel the removal:

\begin{verbatim}
This script will remove the m+m installation from this system,
except for a reference in the system PATH variable.
Are you sure? ([y]es or [N]o):
\end{verbatim}
\outputEnd{}
If you respond with \asCode{Y} or \asCode{Yes}, there is one more opportunity to cancel
the removal:
\outputBegin
\begin{verbatim}
Are you *really* sure? ([y]es or [N]o): n
\end{verbatim}
\outputEnd{}
If you again respond with \asCode{Y} or \asCode{Yes}, the script may prompt you for your
password, in order to perform the actual removal.
After the removal has completed, you will see the following:
\outputBegin
\begin{verbatim}
