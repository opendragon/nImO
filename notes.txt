add SOM as a variant with EOM;
each message is prefixed by k>0 SOMs

need to use some form of out-of-band connection to a port to support connect and disconnect, or else have only the source drop its connections;
the issue is that multiple outgoing and incoming connections must be supported, both TCP and UDP

it appears that both a TCP and a UDP socket can be opened with the same port; perhaps the TCP connection can be used as a transient control port

better approach? --> open a 'control' (UDP?) port for each channel, register it with mDNS with a predictable name; it can be used to add or drop connections, get statistics, et cetera; this would leave the regular channel undisturbed

need naming convention for channel
need description of ASCII representation of data (JSON-like)
need minimal mDNS code, to implement nImOportList

threads, mutex, write+read, read callback
length field to remove the need for SOM/EOM? checksum?

* nImOlist reports all the known channels
* nImOinfo 'c' reports on the connections to the channel 'c'
* nImOversion reports the version of the library
* nImOread 'c' writes out the string representation of messages received on channel 'c'
* nImOwrite 'c' reads the string representation of a message and sends it out channel 'c'
* nImOconnect 'c' 'd' 'm' connects channel 'c' to channel 'd' with mode 'm' (TCP or UDP)
                          [only one connection allowed between 'c' and 'd']
* nImOdisconnect 'c' 'd' removes connection from channel 'c' to channel d'
